# Overview

This is a program that will allow the user to create and log in into an account. The program will then store the user's credentials into a file.

I created this program to demonstrate the use of Kotlin lenguage.

The program will contain the following Kotlin Syntax: 

- Variables (mutable and immutable)

- Expressions

- Conditionals

- Loops

- Functions

- Classes

Here is a video link of me explaining how this program works.
